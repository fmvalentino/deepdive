# DeepDive

DeepDive is a spectroscopic and imaging program with the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). It is designed to investigate the properties and underlying physics of massive quiescent galaxies at redshifts z = 3–4 — galaxies that had already ceased star formation when the universe was just ~2 billion years old. DeepDive collected NIRCam imaging and deep, medium-resolution NIRSpec spectra using the G235M/F170LP grating and filter combination for 10 primary targets in major extragalactic fields, and also confirmed several secondary quiescent galaxies at z > 3. Leveraging NIRSpec’s high multiplexing capability, the program also observed around 600 additional “filler” galaxies across 10 pointings, enabling a range of exciting new science cases in galaxy evolution.

      <p>By analyzing the deep NIRSpec spectra, we recover detailed star formation histories that help constrain when and how rapidly these galaxies formed their stellar mass.</p>
