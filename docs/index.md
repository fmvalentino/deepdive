# DeepDive

DeepDive is a spectroscopic and imaging program with the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). It is designed to investigate the properties and underlying physics of massive quiescent galaxies at redshifts z = 3–4 — galaxies that had already ceased star formation when the universe was just ~2 billion years old. DeepDive collected NIRCam imaging and deep, medium-resolution NIRSpec spectra using the G235M/F170LP grating and filter combination for 10 primary targets in major extragalactic fields, and also confirmed several secondary quiescent galaxies at z > 3. Leveraging NIRSpec’s high multiplexing capability, the program also observed around 600 additional “filler” galaxies across 10 pointings, enabling a range of exciting new science cases in galaxy evolution.

      <h2>Early quiescent galaxies</h2>
      <p>Deep spectroscopic observations reveal faint absorption features in the stars’ atmospheres and emission lines from the remaining ionized gas within these galaxies. This detailed information allows us to measure their total stellar mass, uncover chemical composition, and reconstruct their formation and growth history. We can also detect pockets of ongoing star formation and identify active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. Complemented by exquisite multi-wavelength imaging, these data enable precise measurements of galaxy sizes and structural properties.</p>

      <h2>Strength in numbers</h2>
      <p>We complemented our publicly available observations with a thorough search for massive quiescent galaxies with similar JWST spectroscopic and photometric coverage in the Dawn JWST Archive ([DJA](https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja/index.html)).  All data have been reduced and analyzed in a homogeneous way and are included in our public data release. The result is a comprehensive sample of nearly 150 systems spanning more than 4.5 billion years of cosmic history at redshifts z > 1!</p>

      <h2>Star formation histories</h2>
      <p>By analyzing the deep NIRSpec spectra, we recover detailed star formation histories that help constrain when and how rapidly these galaxies formed their stellar mass.</p>
