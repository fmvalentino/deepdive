**Imaging mosaics**

[TBD]

**Calibrated spectra and photometric catalogs**

The calibrated spectra and photometric catalogs of the DeepDive and archival massive quiescent galaxies can be found here: [Zenodo link](link)
The archive is accompanied by a ReadMe file.

If you use all or part of this dataset, please cite [Ito et al., 2025](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250622642I/abstract).

The spectroscopic and photometric data reduction was performed with `msaexp` and `grizli` by [Gabriel Brammer](https://gbrammer.github.io/) (DAWN, Univ. Copenhagen), respectively, and several data products have been retrieved from the DAWN JWST Archive ([DJA](https://dawn-cph.github.io/dja/index.html)). We warmly encourage the reader to cite the original works reporting details on the data reduction and general data releases:
- `msaexp` and version 3 spectroscopic DJA data release: [de Graaff et al, 2025](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...697A.189D/abstract) and [Heintz+2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025A%26A...693A..60H/abstract); version 4 release and spectral range extension: [Valentino et al. 2025](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250301990V/abstract);
- Photometric data reduction and release: [Valentino et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...947...20V/abstract)
