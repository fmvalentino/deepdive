      <p>Galaxies are enormous self-gravitating collections of hundreds of millions of stars, nebulae of gas and cosmic dust, planets, black holes, and a mysterious "dark" matter. Since the discovery of the existence of galaxies beyond our Milky Way 100 years ago1, astronomers have observed, classified, and measured the physical properties of millions of these systems in order to understand how they form and evolve over time. Particularly outstanding are the most massive galaxies (ten times more than the Milky Way): these are the first systems in the history of the Universe that started forging stars and metals from primordial gas and experiencedthe fastest possible growth, which in most cases abruptly terminated several billion years ago. However, despite decades of investigation, we still lack a coherent explanation of their prodigious growth (100-1000 times faster than that of the Milky Way) and of its sudden halt, with models and simulations invoking ad hoc assumptions to reproduce their observed properties. This project will shed new light on the path of formation and evolution of the first massive galaxies in the Universe.
